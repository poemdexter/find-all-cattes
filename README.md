find-all-cattes
===============

Petfinder is amazing if you're looking for a single cat but what if you're looking for pairs?  find-all-cattes solves this problem by finding all cats with names that contain 'and' or '&' to signal a pair.  find-all-cattes also solves the issue of only 25 results per page by iterating through the entire set of search result pages.

Matches and the petfinder link to matches are pushed to a cat-list.html file and then uploaded via FTP to poemdexter.com/cat-list.html
